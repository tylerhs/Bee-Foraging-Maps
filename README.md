### Bee-Foraging-Maps

This project involves using quadrotors equipped with an RGB camera to build maps of landscapes in the Bernard Field Station. These maps will be analyzed using image processing algorithms, and ground photos of flowers will be fed into machine learning software to identify areas with high and low flower density.
